                            Chapter 1
                        </h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p>A place where you can find all the stories of the world.</p>
                        <p>Each having its own planet or even dimension.</p>
                        <p>Not knowing about each other, they co-exist peacefully.</p>
                        <p>Only with the strongest space magic can one cross the well-guarded borders of these worlds.</p>
                        <p>In the middle of it all, there's a tiny planet.</p>
                        <p>This planet has a secret.</p>
                        <p>Every now and then, a lost soul arrives, and the planet grants them a body.</p>
                        <p>When they fall asleep, they return to their original worlds into their original bodies and think of it as
                            a dream.</p>
                        <p>But then again, when the night comes, they find themselves on the tiny planet in their new bodies, just
                            as if they've never left in the first place.</p>
                        <p>On this planet there are a handful individuals who use magic.</p>
                        <p>The people call them 『Fairies』.</p>
                        <p>Just as they needed talented warriors, kingdoms needed fairies.</p>
                        <p>A magical contract was made that would tie a fairy to a kingdom.</p>
                        <p>If they signed, they had to protect the kingdom by all means and couldn't refuse orders from the current
                            ruler.</p>
                        <p>In return, the rulers gave the fairies whatever they asked for.</p>
                        <p>Thus, all lived well and in harmony. There never was a lack of food or bedding, one helped another, until
                            one day, a young boy was born.</p>
                        <p>He was brighter than any of the scholars, he could do whatever he wanted with ease, his handsome face was
                            well known all over the continent.</p>
                        <p>However, he had but one flaw.</p>
                        <p>He, who could do anything, felt no joy by these accomplishments. He was bored. He wanted more.</p>
                        <p>That was when it hit him.</p>
                        <p>What if he had more power? Power to rule over the continent, no, the entire world-</p>
                        <p>That was the start of a war that lasted for decades. During these times, the importance of the fairies
                            rose. The more fairies a kingdom had, the more firepower they controlled.</p>
                        <p>Many lives were lost, many more tears shed but time passed, and as always, the war came to an end.</p>
                        <p>The kingdoms all agreed to end the war, there was but one, final thing to mourn…</p>
                        <p>Fairies… most of them were gone.</p>
                        <p>This was when the suggestion came:</p>
                        <p><q>No kingdom should have more than one fairy. That way, the powers would be balanced, and no more wars
                            would follow</q></p>
                        <p>They agreed and went their ways, many years passed since then.</p>
                        <p>This is a tale about a certain fairy and the people she met along the way.</p>
            
                        <hr>
            
                        <p>Robin shuddered. She just received that letter and even so, that annoying snakish guy just can't seem to
                            leave her alone.</p>
                        <p><q>I should blow up this entire place. Maybe that'll shut him up</q> she thought. <q>Nah- it would be too much
                            hassle. Maybe next time.</q></p>
                        <p>She once again looked at the letter, somewhat hoping that its contents would change. Obviously, they
                            didn't. Ethernia died. It was a peaceful death, she had lived a long life, but still. Robina just lost
                            her teacher who was like a grandmother to her. More accurately, she was the only person on the planet
                            who she considered family.</p>
                        <p>Apparently, Robin was one of the people from the『Other Worlds』. She's been coming over since she was little,
                            so it would have been dangerous for her to remain alone at that age. Thus, Lady Ethernia took her in and
                            taught her magic.</p>
                        <p>In the letter, she asked Robin to take her place as the guardian fairy of Cyan Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>After thinking it through, Robina decided to first take a look at the situation of the kingdom.</p>
                        <p>She originally started her journey to find a country to settle down in, but none of them matched her taste.
                            They were either not worth protecting or had a ruler whose personality irritated Robin.</p>
                        <p>The Helia Empire was prosperous, the Kalam Duchy never faced any danger.</p>
                        <p>Miriem Kingdom had a reliable queen, they never needed a fairy.</p>
                        <p>And there were several more countries like this Kingdom called Latem, with incompetent snakish leaders
                            like Serpa.</p>
                        <p>Compared to that, Cyan seemed like a good deal. It was a considerably new country that was established
                            after the war. Its sole purpose was to defeat the monsters that emerged from the Forbidden Forest which
                            is a reason fair enough to need a fairy.</p>
                        <p>Because Ethernia was its 『Guardian Fairy』, Robin spent most of her younger years there. It's been long
                            since she left, so that makes another reason to return.</p>
                        <p>Ignoring Serpa, who is still doing his best to persuade her that Latem is indeed, in need of a fairy,
                            Robin leaves the caste through the window.</p>
                        <p><q>Yosh, I decided. Let's go home!</q></p>
