                        <h2>Appearance</h2>
                        <p>As people say, you can hardly find anyone who can match <b>Princess Rose</b>'s <i>beauty</i>. Her <i>long</i>,
                            <i>shining</i> hair goes
                            from <i>Wild Strawberry</i> to <i>Cotton Candy</i> colour. Her eyes are also <i>Strawberry</i> coloured with a
                            tint of <i>Light Yellow</i>.</p>
                        <p>Even without a <i>corset</i> she has a <i>naturally slender waistline</i> and a <i>light body</i>, which she
                            carries gracefully as
                            she walks.</p>
                        <p>Despite her <i>beautiful shape</i>, <b>Rose</b> still wears a <i>corset</i> just to look even more <i>perfect</i>. Most
                            of the time, she
                            can be seen in the most <i>fashionable dresses</i> and <i>high-heeled shoes</i>, even though they both are
                            <i>
                                unbearably
                                uncomfortable

                            <p>Only later, by the influence of <i>Sammie</i>, does she start wearing more <i>comfortable clothes</i>.

                        </details>

                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <p>As we get to know her, <b>Rosalia</b> takes pride in her <i>perfection</i>. She's proud and she's willing
                            to <i>sacrifice anything</i> in order to maintain the <i>pretence of the perfect girl</i>. She is seen <i>ruthless</i> and
                            <i>evil</i> by those
                            around her.</p>
                        <p>Not only does she <i>aim to be perfect</i>, but she <i>expects</i> the same from her people. She carefully
                            makes her plans
                            and wants them to be <i>executed flawlessly</i>. Not considering the <i>human imperfection</i>, her plans
                            have a tendency
                            to fail, although, in many cases, only by a <i>short margin</i> because despite everything, <b>Rose</b> is
                            <i>
                                incredibly
                                smart
                            </i> and a <i>great tactician</i>.</p>

                            <p>
                                Meeting <i>Samantha</i> grants her the confidence to <i>stand up</i> against her parents and accept
                                that she can't and
                                doesn't have to be <i>perfect</i>. After that, she acts all <i>tsundere-like</i> in front of people
                                which everyone
                                thinks is cute. Having a difficulty to share her <i>honest thoughts</i>, she often becomes
                                <i>embarrassed</i>, and she
                                brushes it off with offensive comments that she, <i>obviously</i>, doesn't mean.
                            </p>

                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p>During her childhood, <b>Rosalia</b> was required to act as the <i>perfect princess</i>. Her parents
                            tolerated <i>no mistakes</i>.
                            She considered it <i>normal</i> to be treated like that and did everything to <i>please them</i>. Even
                            then, she never
                            received proper <i>parental love</i>.</p>
                        <p>After <i>Lilith</i>, her sister was born, she had to <i>work even harder</i>, not to be compared to her.
                        </p>
                        <p>She was continuously <i>pressured to marry</i> a person with wealth and high social standing. This
                            was when <i>Prince</i>
                            came to her mind, who she met a few times before at parties. He met all the <i>requirements</i>,
                            was <i>handsome</i>, kind
                            and didn't have a <i>fiancé</i>. Unfortunately, <i>Prince</i> told her that he wanted to marry <i>
                                the person
                                he loved
                            </i>.</p>
                        <p>Not understanding his <i>selfish reasoning</i>, <b>Rose</b> prepared all kinds of <i>shames</i> to make him want
                            her, but
                            <i>ultimately, she failed</i>, and <i>Robin</i> arrived. <b>Rose</b>, who couldn't stand <i>to lose against</i> someone
                            like <i>Robina</i>, did
                            everything to get rid of her, which only made her situation worse.</p>

                            <p><b>Rose</b> was almost <i>executed by Prince</i>, but <i>Robin</i> stopped him. Her parents were <i>ashamed</i> of
                                her
                                and wanted to <i>throw her out</i>.</p>
                            <p>That was when she met <i>Samantha</i>. The girl fell for <b>Rose</b> for first sight and wouldn't leave
                                her
                                alone. Taken aback by the sudden affection, <b>Rose</b> tried to shoo her away, but it didn't
                                work. Eventually, she
                                also fell for Sammie, stood up against her parents and started <i>living for herself</i>.</p>

                        <h2>Abilities</h2>
                        <p>Despite being <i>beautiful</i>, her beauty can hardly be called her <i>main strength</i>. <b>Rose</b> uses her
                            looks in any way
                            she can, but she never relies solely on it. After all, she was born with The <i>

                                Blessing
                            </i>:</p>
                        <p>She <i>excels in business</i>; she has a talent for <i>conducting trials</i>. When there's a <i>conflict</i>, she
                            leads the
                            negotiations so that no one leaves <i>damaged</i>. She avoided conflicts with neighbouring
                            countries so that <i>Divia</i>
                            doesn't have to go to war.</p>
                        <p>Her true strength lies in her <i>strategies</i>. She is brilliant. She's been <i>managing Divia</i> since a
                            young age which
                            is the reason why the <i>commoners</i> love her so much. The current <i>Divia is prosperous</i> thanks to
                            her, but she
                            believes that it would be fine even without her, which is not true. She has the power to
                            move the people to
                            an extent that they would be ready to do anything for her.</p>
