                            Cyan
                        </h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p><b>Cyan</b> is a fairly new kingdom, founded after the war. Its purpose is to get rid of the
                            monsters that leave
                            the
                            <i>Forbidden Forest</i>. It was only later, that they found out about <i>Alias</i> and
                            started the fight with him and
                            his
                            subordinates. Along the border of the <i>Forbidden Forest</i>, they tied a red thread to the
                            trees so that
                            everyone
                            knew where the danger zone started.
                        </p>
                        <p>There were occasionally subjugation teams that entered the forest. They mainly consisted of
                            the royal
                            knights
                            of <b>Cyan</b>. Usually, the king or the queen led them, but as time went by, they aged and
                            reliable commanders
                            took care of it instead of them. The prince and the princess of <b>Cyan</b> are coming of
                            age soon, and after
                            that,
                            it will be their turn to lead the troops.</p>
                        <p>The royal heirs both are very capable. <i>Her Highness the Royal Princess</i> learned healing magic
                            from <i>Lady Ethernia</i>, the <i>Fairy of Cyan</i>. She's also a reliable commander and a great fighter. Although, in
                            combat, her brother, <i>His Highness the Royal Prince</i> is the real prodigy. He could be considered a
                            genius of their generation, not many can fight with a sword as well as he can. The inheritance of the throne
                            between them is still undecided, but both are willing to step down if the other is named successor.</p>
                        <p>The town is mostly peaceful, the <i>Royal Family</i> considers the well-being of their people top priority. 
                            <i>The Royal Highnesses</i> have a habit of hanging around in the town, so they are very close with the residents.
                            Most of their people live by growing fruits, wheat, and other plants. There are also bakers,
                            craftsmen, and a few others. The monsters' meat is edible, so they don't have to breed livestock.</p>
                        <p>The Kingdom's other speciality is <i>Gilla</i>. It's a type of carrot, which looks a bit like
                            a huge, deformed potato. By huge, think of it as a size of two fists. When you eat it, <i>Gilla</i> tastes
                            sweet, then the aftertaste is magical. Sadly, it only lives in harsh environments, so only <b>Cyan</b> is
                            able to produce them, which is the main source of their income beside the monsters.</p>
