                            Miscommunication
                        </h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p><q>Can somebody help me with this decoration?</q></p>
                        <p><q>We need more people in the kitchen!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Aghh, the garden is still a mess; who is in charge of the garden?!</q></p>
                        <p><q>I'd love to help, but I'd need at least a dozen of clones only to finish my own tasks, sorry!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Coming through, get out of my way; I'm carrying fragile stuff!</q></p>
                        <p>The castle of Cyan was in an uproar. Prince invited his friend, Duchess Idette and her husband, Duke Lukas to Cyan to congratulate them on their wedding. </p>
                        <p>There were all sorts of bad rumours regarding their relationship. They were said to be distant and cold to each other. Because of this, Prince was really worried about Idette's happiness.</p>
                        <p><q>I'm sure she could have just called off the engagement! What if he abuses her? What if she's just enduring the pain by herself? Idette is a really soft-spoken person, she might not be able to--</q></p>
                        <p><q>You really treasure your ex-fiancé, don't you?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Robin--!</q>  </p>
                        <p>The fairy walked into her partner's room.</p>
                        <p><q>It's not like that, I…</q></p>
                        <p><q>Prince</q> - before he could have continued, Robina stopped him. - <q>I know you're worried. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm concerned about her, too. But you have to calm down, or it will affect your health. And what if he turns out to be a piece of trash? I'll get rid of him if he is, you can be sure about that.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Robin…</q></p>
                        <p><q>Okay, I have a few shadow-clones running around helping the staff, so I'm considerably free. I'll listen to your concerns if that can ease your mind a little.</q></p>
                        <p><q>No, you really don't have to, I'm all right…</q></p>
                        <p><q>I don't want to go back to work. Please talk to me Prince.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Ahhaha… it can't be helped then, I guess? Come here.</q></p>
                        <p>They both sat on Prince's bed and talked about all sorts of things for the rest of the afternoon. During the night they both slept rather peacefully. Then, morning came.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The Greeting Ceremony was a great success. Although there wasn't any change in the duke's expression, Idette couldn't stop adoring the decoration, and the fancy meals. The people of the castle were overjoyed.</p>
                        <p>Later that day Duke Lucas had to go over some paperwork, so Prince and Robin could finally talk in private with Idette.</p>
                        <p><q>Are you alright, Idette?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Why do you ask? I'm… alright I guess.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Does he abuse you?</q></p>
                        <p><q>What?</q> Idette looked with a startled face.</p>
                        <p><q>Sorry Idette. Robin just wanted to ask what you think about Lucas.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Well…</q> Idette seemed to be lost in thought. <q>He's…</q></p>
                        <p>Silence. The one who broke it was none other than Anna, who just arrived after giving Lucas some extra work to do.</p>
                        <p><q>You can tell us no matter what it is.</q></p>
                        <p><q>I…</q> Idette hesitated but continued. <q>He's just so cool! But he hates me… I know. He never talks to me and always acts distant…</q></p>
                        <p><q>WHAT--?</q> the others blurted out.</p>
                        <p><q>Eh…? Did I say something wrong?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Do you… like him? But people say you hate each other!</q></p>
                        <p><q>What? No! I'm totally head over heels for him... That's my problem.</q> </p>
                        <p><q>I'm gonna talk to him.</q></p>
                        <p><q>What? Robin, no!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Chill, I won't tell him anything, I'll just ask what he thinks about you!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Don't--!</q> but it was futile. Robin already used teleportation to jump into Lucas' working room.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><q>Hi Lucas, can I ask you a question?</q></p>
                        <p>A pile of papers fell onto the floor. Lucas looked in the direction of the voice and the fairy who just teleported came into his view.</p>
                        <p><q>What do you want?</q> he asked coldly.</p>
                        <p><q>What do you think about Idette?</q></p>
                        <p>The question startled him. Then, he blushed. Robin took her time enjoying the changes in his facial expressions, although it didn't last long. He spoke:</p>
                        <p><q>I… adore her…</q></p>
                        <p><q>How much?</q> Robin asked eagerly. It was only a question to tease him, but the response was surprisingly good.</p>
                        <p><q>More than anything.</q> he said it calmly, but confidently.</p>
                        <p><q>Did you ever tell her this?</q></p>
                        <p><q>What? No way!</q> He was startled again. <q>She hates me… She always shivers when I'm next to her…</q></p>
                        <p><q>Yeah, shivers in bliss</q> Robin thought. <q>I feel like we encountered another problematic couple.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Why don't you try telling her? She might like you back, you never know.</q></p>
                        <p><q>That's impossible! I'm telling you she's afraid of me.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Okay, listen. Idette loves you. You love her back. Now go and confess, so that all of us can sleep tight tonight.</q></p>
                        <p><q>What are you talking about?? There's no way something like that is possible!</q></p>
                        <p><q>No matter what?</q></p>
                        <p><q>No matter what.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Okay, then.</q> With that, Robin teleported again.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p><q>He loves you.</q></p>
                        <p><q>What-??</q> the reappearing Robin surprised Idette. </p>
                        <p><q>He said he loves you.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Thanks Robin, for trying to cheer me up, but that's just not possible…</q></p>
                        <p><q>Uh huh. So, you don't believe me.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Sorry Robin, I'm thankful, but…</q></p>
                        <p>With this, Robin decided to do anything to make this ship work. Every day, she would tell them to confess, tried many tactics, but nothing worked. </p>
                        <p>During this time, Lucas buried himself in work, while Idette spent most of her time with Prince. Because of this, Robin could spend less and less time with her partner. </p>
                        <p>Finally, the fairy had enough. She met up with Leo.</p>
                        <p><q>What's up, Robin?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Leo. Do you perhaps know a reliable Adventurers Guild?</q></p>
                        <p><q>If that's what you need, go to Terbian's. They're pretty much the best I know. But why do you need adventurers?</q> </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Later that week. </p>
                        <p>Robin invited Idette to the town, to hang out. It was only a loyal maid of Idette who accompanied them.</p>
                        <p>They ate a bunch of delicious food, met the people of the town, and overall had a lot of fun. </p>
                        <p>That was when it happened. Robin left her companions alone just for a few minutes, to get some cotton candy. Suddenly, a bunch of scary-looking men came out of the alley, surrounding Idette and her maid, Leslie.</p>
                        <p>Although they ignored Leslie, Idette was kidnapped. The young maid panicked and ran for help, but Robin was nowhere to be found. </p>
                        <p>Then, miraculously, she noticed Duke Lucas in the crowd. He was having his day off, visiting the town. Leslie ran towards him.</p>
                        <p><q>Duke! Help! Please!</q></p>
                        <p>Lucas turned around surprised and asked her for details. When he heard that Idette has been kidnapped, all color left his face. Enraged, he ordered Leslie to take him to wherever she last saw Idette. </p>
                        <p>Following the alley, they began to search for the kidnappers.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Idette woke up in a small hut, surrounded by the bandits. </p>
                        <p><q>Where am I? What do you want from me…?</q></p>
                        <p>But no answer came. Instead, the one who seemed to be the leader, spoke.</p>
                        <p><q>The young lady shouldn't talk so much. Silent women sell for more in the black market. Although, the Missy will earn us a decent income with that face.</q></p>
                        <p><q>What?!</q></p>
                        <p>The man smirked.</p>
                        <p><q>Oh, don't be so stiff. We might as well have some fun with you before selling you. It would be a waste not to, after all.</q></p>
                        <p>A shiver ran through Idette's spine. She knew, she had to flee, but how? The men reached for her. In the same moment, Idette bit his hand, stood up and ran for the door. </p>
                        <p>But it was futile. The bandits held her down, before she could do anything. Suddenly, the door swung open, and the furious Lucas walked into the room.</p>
                        <p><q>Idette, close your eyes.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Huh-?</q></p>
                        <p>By the time the bandits had time to react, it was already over. The dead bodies filled the room, only the boss remained alive, but seriously injured. </p>
                        <p><q>Are you okay, Idette…?</q> Lucas asked. The girl was in tears.</p>
                        <p><q>Why…? Why did you come for me…?</q></p>
                        <p><q>What?</q></p>
                        <p><q>You… you hate me, don't you? Then why…?</q></p>
                        <p><q>What? No! Idette, I love you! How could I ever hate someone as sweet as you?!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Eh--?</q> Idette couldn't believe her ears. <q>You… you love me?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Ughh… I'm sorry, just forget what I said…</q></p>
                        <p><q>What…?</q></p>
                        <p><q>I'm sorry, I know I make you uncomfortable, but I couldn't bear to divorce you… but I made up my mind, I want you to be happy, so—</q></p>
                        <p><q>Lucas!</q> Idette interrupted him. <q>I love you! You're the coolest person I know! So please…, please, don't divorce me!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Eh--?</q> Now it was Lucas's turn to be surprised. </p>
                        <p>Finally, the two of them spoke honestly with each other, and realized that their love was mutual. There was only one thing left. Lucas turned to the tortured leader of the bandits.</p>
                        <p><q>Who do you work for?</q></p>
                        <p><q>What?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Don't play dumb, Prince told me that there were no bandits in Cyan. Then who could you be working for?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Ha—like I'd tell you!</q></p>
                        <p>Lucas smirked.</p>
                        <p><q>I hoped you would say that.</q> </p>
                        <p>With that, he drew his sword again and started torturing the man. Only then, did the bandit speak.</p>
                        <p><q>Okay, okay I'll speak!</q></p>
                        <p><q>I'd be fast if I were you. My sword is rather restless today. So, I'll ask once more. Who hired you?</q></p>
                        <p><q>It was Lady Robina! It's the truth, I swear! Please, spare my life!</q></p>
                        <p>In the same moment, Lucas' sword swung, and the man dropped dead. </p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Robina was sitting on the sofa of the palace's tea-room, opposite of her were the shaking Idette and her husband. </p>
                        <p><q>How could you--?</q> Lucas glared at Robin. </p>
                        <p><q>Mind letting me into whatever you're talking about?</q> the fairy asked calmly.</p>
                        <p><q>Don't play innocent! You kidnapped Idette!</q></p>
                        <p><q>No, I didn't. I made others do it. There's no way I'd get my hands dirty with something minor like that.</q></p>
                        <p><q>What?! Were you really that jealous, that Prince spent more time with Idette, than with you?!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Lucas, please, stop it, there's no way Robin would—</q></p>
                        <p><q>And what if I was?</q></p>
                        <p>Silence. Then, the sound of something falling onto the ground.  Prince, who was standing in the door till now, dropped the book he was holding. He couldn't believe his ears.</p>
                        <p><q>Robin, there's no way… Why would you…? No, it must be a misunderstanding!</q></p>
                        <p><q>And what if it isn't?</q> Robin stood up and slowly walked towards Prince. <q>As a matter of fact, I did hire people to get rid of Idette. But isn't it great? In the end, the two of them became so lovely-dovely. Indeed, how delightful.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Robin! I…</q> Prince shuttered while making a pained face, then stormed out of the room. Lucas grabbed Robin by the hand.</p>
                        <p><q>What? Wasn't it enough for you to hurt Prince? What else do you want?</q> Robin asked annoyed.</p>
                        <p><q>You were the one who tried to hurt Idette; Prince has the right to know what kind of person you really are!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Ha—</q> Robin smirked painfully as Lucas' grip tightened.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Prince entered his room. He just couldn't believe Robin would do something like that out of jealousy. </p>
                        <p>The always cheerful, kind Robin he knew… Prince started to regret acting the way he did. </p>
                        <p><q>Right, there's no way Robin would have done something like that.</q> he told himself. Not that he fully believed Robin was innocent, but he wanted to believe in his partner. </p>
                        <p>Setting his mind on proving her innocence, he started asking around about how Robin was behaving during the past weeks and whether anyone saw anything odd.  </p>
                        <p>A maid who happened to overhear Robin's conversation with Leo, told Prince that the fairy was searching for a reliable Adventurers Guild and her friend recommended her Terbian's.</p>
                        <p>Prince, knowing he couldn't get Leo tell him anything, set off to Terbian's. In the main hall, the daughter of the guild master, Rachel greeted him. </p>
                        <p>Prince asked about the job Robina came to offer, but Rachel refused to answer, as the privacy of the client was important in Terbian's. </p>
                        <p>Losing hope, Prince returned to the palace. There, he ran into Robin. As the fairy saw him, she began to walk away, but Prince caught her by her hand.</p>
                        <p>Robin hissed in pain although he held her gently. </p>
                        <p><q>Why does everyone feel like grabbing my hand today?</q></p>
                        <p>Prince pulled up her sleeve and saw the bruise on her hand. He was devastated.</p>
                        <p><q>Did Luke do this?? Why didn't you heal it yet?</q></p>
                        <p><q>That's none of your business.</q></p>
                        <p>Robin pulled her hand back and left. For a few minutes, Prince just stood there, unsure of what to do. Then, night came.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>The next day, Prince was notified that a man from Terbian's guild requested an audience with him. He let the man in.</p>
                        <p>His name was Thunk, and he called himself the leader of the group who kidnapped Idette. </p>
                        <p><q>But Lucas said, he killed everyone… how can you be alive?</q></p>
                        <p><q>That's because—</q></p>
                        <p>That moment, Robin walked in.</p>
                        <p><q>Do you really think that these adventurers can be paid enough to kidnap someone? Although, it was fairly easy with hostages…</q></p>
                        <p><q>Robin--!</q></p>
                        <p>The girl sat down on the sofa, beside Prince, with a confident expression.</p>
                        <p><q>This one here for example, has a wife and an adorable little daughter—</q></p>
                        <p><q>I'm sorry Miss Robina, but I can't keep watching as this misunderstanding is ruining the relationship between the two of you!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Ha, see? He's soo concerned about his family, that he—</q></p>
                        <p><q>MISS ROBINA!</q> Thunk shouted and grabbed Robin by her shoulders. </p>
                        <p>In the same moment, Prince wrapped his hands around his partner and pulled her away from Thunk. Desperately clinging onto her from the back, he lowered his head onto Robin's shoulder.</p>
                        <p>The girl was caught totally off guard. She turned away as her face became red.</p>
                        <p>Silence.</p>
                        <p><q>Do whatever you want…</q> she mumbled, finally giving up on protecting her well-kept secret.</p>
                        <p>Thus, Thunk could finally began his speech.</p>
                        <p><q class="begin-q">Miss Robina came to our guild and asked for the most intimidatingly looking men. Be it a huge build, many scars, or a loud voice, all were welcomed.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="mid-q">We were all invited to the usual meeting room to meet the client. She told us to leave if we are not ready to keep everything that she is about to say a secret.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="mid-q">She also told us that we're free to leave any time if we refuse to take part. Then, she began the explanation.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="mid-q">We were told that there were a young lady and lord, who liked each other but refused to believe that the other person also felt the same.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="end-q">The plan was to set up a stage, where the young lady is kidnapped, and is saved by the young lord. We were playing the part of the kidnappers.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Wait, but wasn't it only by luck, that the maid asked Lucas for help?</q></p>
                        <p><q>That…</q> Robin finally spoke again, but her voice was softer than before. <q class="begin-q">Leslie knew that Idette and Lucas liked each other so she naturally thought that asking Lucas for help would be a good idea.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="end-q">Also, I heard from Lucas that he was going to the town on his day off. The rest was easy. I just had to invite Idette and Leslie, wait for a moment when we are close enough to Lucas, and disappear to buy, for example, cotton candy.</q></p>
                        <p><q>That's brilliant…</q> Thunk couldn't coat his admiration.</p>
                        <p><q>Weren't you part of the plan? How come you didn't know about that?</q> Prince asked.</p>
                        <p><q class="begin-q">We were only requested to abduce the young lady when Miss Robina signals, take her to an easy-to-find hut not too far away and to scare her a little bit.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="mid-q">But Miss Robina made it especially clear that she wouldn't tolerate if any of us were to touch the young lady.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="mid-q">She also told us, that the young lord has a bad temper, so he might try to kill or torture us. For that reason, she used some kind of magic on us, that made us unable to feel pain during the mission. The magic made it so, that if we were to die, we could be revived by her afterwards. </q></p>
                        <p><q class="mid-q">That is the reason why me and my comrades are alive.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="mid-q">The Miss is really kind, she told us that if we were unable to watch our comrades getting hurt or if we were tortured, we should confess that she forced us to kidnap the young lady against our will.</q></p>
                        <p><q class="end-q">So please, don't be angry with her, she really didn't mean to harm anybody…!</q></p>
                        <p><q>So that's why--!</q></p>
                        <p><q>What?</q></p>
                        <p><q>That's why you didn't heal your bruise that day! You couldn't… because you used too much power to keep these people alive.</q></p>
                        <p><q>No, I… can't we just ignore that part? It sounds lame to be weakened that much by just a few spells…</q></p>
                        <p><q>What few spells? Robin, you used magic to revive people, and made them unable to feel pain. Moreover, it wasn't only one or two people. There's hardly anyone who could do that after you, so what's wrong with being weak afterwards?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Well, actually, I didn't 'revive' them, I just used a spell that would catch their souls if they died during the mission, so that after Lukas was done, I could put them back into their cured bodies… I am yet to discover a way to decently revive people after all.</q></p>
                        <p><q>It doesn't matter. You did well. But… next time, could you not… keep it a secret? At least from me?</q></p>
                        <p><q>You would have stopped me, tho?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Well… yes, but even so, why were you so keen on keeping it a secret?</q></p>
                        <p><q>I mean… I did plan the whole kidnapping thing and all, so it's not like I'm innocent or anything… Also, from the beginning, I never planned to tell Lucas and Idette my reason for the kidnapping, it's not like I have any proof that I meant no harm, and then you also saw the scene I caused and I just, I don't know, at that point I just wanted to stick to my story so badly, and--</q></p>
                        <p><q>Robin</q></p>
                        <p><q>Ah, sorry, I started rambling again, didn't I?</q></p>
                        <p><q>No, I also apologize for my behaviour. I shouldn't have doubted you, I--</q></p>
                        <p><q>No, no, no, no, no. Don't. Even I would doubt myself after that performance. That was the goal after all. It's not your fault that you happened to be watching.</q></p>
                        <p><q>But even so, I should've taken your side… because we're partners… and I don't want to be on any other side beside yours.</q></p>
                        <p><q>You know, you say the sweetest things, and you're incredibly adorable when you do, but what would you do if I decided to become a real villainess that really hurts people?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Then I'd become your villain. It doesn't matter if the whole world is against us as long as you're with me.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Prince, you… Aghh, whatever. Just… don't let me hurt you, no matter what. Okay?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Yeah.</q></p>
                        <p>Prince stayed with Robin for the next few hours, and Thunk, who considered his job done, said farewell and went on his way.</p>
                        <p>Next day, they talked with Idette and Lucas to clear the misunderstanding. Idette was glad that Robin didn't want to hurt her, although Lucas still glared at her every time they met during the next few months.</p>
                        <p>Moral of the story?</p>
                        <p>Talk to each other.</p>
                        <p>So that the bystanders don't have to suffer while watching you continuously misunderstand each other.</p>
