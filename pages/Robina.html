                        <h2>Appearance</h2>
                        <p><b>Robina</b>'s body was originally granted by the planet. However, it doesn't affect her
                            appearance nor how her body works.</p>
                        <p><b>Robina</b> has <i>Sorrell Brown</i> hair and <i>Dark Emerald Green</i> eyes. In her
                            younger years, her hair is shoulder length, but it grows a lot during her travels. After she
                            returns to Cyan, she cuts her hair because it inconveniences her during a fight.</p>
                        <p><b>Robina</b> wants to believe that her height is at least average, but she's rather short.
                            Her body is really fit but still skinny. She claims that it's because of her genes.</p>
                        <p>She wears many different but comfortable outfits. Her most common ones are her
                            <i>Chara-cosplay</i> from <i>UNDERTALE</i>, and a red dress that Prince gave her as a gift.
                            The people of Cyan mostly have winter-coloured outfits, so she usually stands out a bit.</p>

                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <p><b>Robin</b> is a <i>self-confident</i> person, who greatly values her freedom. Despite her
                            <i>often-cynical</i> remarks, she has a kind heart and cares a lot about her friends. She highly
                            values life, as she prefers not to kill anyone if it's not necessary. This became one of her
                            reasons to get stronger. <i>Strong enough</i>, that no one has to die around her.</p>
                        <p>During her journey throughout the continent, <b>Robin</b> developed a considerable distrust
                            towards <i>high-ranking</i> people. Seeing that many of them are <i>not suitable</i> for their position, she
                            became more and more sceptical when meeting new ones. This was somewhat eased after she
                            returned to Cyan and met Prince. She shows great appreciation towards the rulers who she
                            finds capable.</p>
                        <p><b>Robin</b> is not led by a <i>sense of justice</i>; she mainly does things for her <i>own
                            entertainment</i>. Later, her motivation becomes <i>protecting Prince</i> and helping him achieve
                            whatever he wants. Even then, she doesn't really feel hate towards her opponents as she's
                            more interested in their reasons for acting the way they do.</p>
                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <p><b>Robin</b> was around 4 or 5 years old when she woke up on the planet for the first time.
                            Ethernia found her, and realizing the child's situation, she took her in. As Ethernia looked
                            after many children in Cyan while their parents were working, <b>Robina</b> found many
                            friends early on.</p>
                        <p>For these years, she was taught magic by Ethernia. She had a <i>carefree childhood</i>, but studying
                            magic is highly difficult, so she struggled a lot with it. Despite that, she was determined
                            to master all kinds of magic as there wasn't any magic in her <i>original world</i> and after
                            seeing Ethernia use it, it became her dream to be able to do the same.</p>
                        <p>Years later, she was finally good enough to be called a <i>Fairy</i>. Because Ethernia was already
                            the <i>Guardian Fairy of Cyan</i>, <b>Robina</b> had to go on a journey, to find herself a country.
                            During these years, she learned all kinds of <i>fighting styles</i> and <i>techniques</i> from all around
                            the continent; her magic also became much stronger as she experienced many <i>unexpected
                            situations</i>.</p>
                        <p>It was when she met <i>Leo</i> and they traveled together for a long time. <b>Robina</b> also became
                            acquainted with many of the rulers of the regions, including <i>Idette</i>, <i>Vicky</i> and <i>Serpa</i>.</p>
                        <p>After being notified about Ethernia's death, she returned to Cyan and became <i>
                            Prince's
                                personal guard
                        </i>.</p>
                        <h2>Abilities</h2>
                        <p><b>Robin</b>'s biggest strength is <i>her magic</i>. Her main element is <i>air</i>, but she is capable of
                            using any kind of magic. Because she started at a <i>young age</i> and she's rather <i>talented</i>,
                            there's hardly anyone who could overpower her.</p>
                        <p>Her other main element is <i>space magic</i>, which was Ethernia's speciality. More accurately,
                            <i>portals</i>. She had a hard time mastering it, but now she can <i>teleport</i> not just to anywhere on
                            the planet but to <i>other dimensions</i> as well. Her magic easily slips through the barriers of
                            the 『Tales』. Although she can't modify the storylines, she has a habit of <i>
                                entering the
                                worlds</i> of different tales
                             and <i>interacting</i> with the characters. Sometimes, she even brings
                            <i>Prince</i> along.</p>
                        <p>With the power to enter <i>different tales</i>, she has the ability, to <i>copy</i> their powers and <i>use</i>
                            them wherever she wants to. Of course, it would be <i>dangerous</i> if she overused it, but she
                            insists that she has a <i>poor memory</i> so if she needs to defeat someone and there is <i>
                                suitable
                                magic
                            </i>to deal with it, she might not realize that in the moment of the <i>fight</i>.</p>
                        <p>Even without magic, <b>Robin</b> is <i>considerably strong</i>. She can <i>win against</i> many of the
                            knights in Cyan, who are considered the <i>most powerful elites</i> on the continent after <i>
                                Miriam's
                                army
