                            Chapter 3
                        </h1>
                        <hr>
                        
                        <p>Next day, Robin was finally reaching Ethernia's place. She could almost see the small wooden building across the river.</p>
                        <p>One rock, two rocks, three... You have to know the river well to be able to cross it like Robin does. She's carefreely jumping from rock to rock, avoiding all the slippery ones. Just as she reaches the other side, a familiar voice calles out to her.</p>
                        <p><q>Robin!</q></p>
                        <p>It's the thief guy from yesterday. What is he even doing here?</p>
                        <p><q>Wait for me!</q></p>
                        <p><q>Hey- WATCH OUT!</q></p>
                        <p>But it was too late. The boy landed on the unstable rock and fell into the water. Robin could see as he hit his head in another rock and lost consciousness. </p>
                        <p><q>Ughhh... why does this person keep getting into trouble every turn?</q></p>
                        <p>Despite complaining in her head, she immediately jumped after him and rescued the boy from the river.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Ryat was annoyed. Prince was the one asking him to accompany him to Ethernia's house and now, here he is, in the middle of the forest, alone. Alone. ALONE. Oh, and where is Prince? Ryat would LOVE. TO. KNOW. </p>
                        <p>His companion ran ahead shouting back something about seeing a familiar face. In. The. Woods. ??? </p>
                        <p>Riat is very annoyed. He doesn't care what squrrel or bunny Prince saw that reminded him of one of his own. He thinks it's ridiculous to be left alone in the woods when he didn't even want to come. </p>
                        <p>Riat sighed. Nothing can be done. He decided to head to Ethernia's place in the hopes of finding his companion there. </p>
                        <p>As he reached the clearing with the river, he was met with a shocking sight. On the other side of the river, Prince was laying on the ground, passed out. Beside him was a girl Ryat has never seen before. They were both drenched. </p>
                        <p>Ryat immediately put up his defenses and reached for his sword. He had no idea who the girl was but there was a chance she hurt Prince. And if she did, she needed to pay. </p>
                        <p>Before he could've moved though, the girl looked up.</p>
                        <p><q>Who's there?</q></p>
