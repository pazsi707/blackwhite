                            Chapter 2
                        </h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p>It only took a few hours for Robin to reach the border of Cyan.</p>
                        <p>At times like these, having teleportation magic is indeed, convenient.</p>
                        <p>She wanted to go to Ethernia's house to pay her respects but using too much magic in a short time wore her out. There was still a long way to Ethernia's house, so she decided to spend the night in the town. </p>
                        <p>Jumping from rooftop to rooftop, she suddenly noticed a boy fleeing from the palace with a loaf of bread in his hand. A handful of Royal Guards were after him. </p>
                        <p><q>Whoa, such a prosperous country that commoners have to steal from the castle</q> she thought. <q>I can't believe the Cyan I trusted so much has betrayed me. Ahh, corruption reaches everywhere…</q></p>
                        <p>Out of interest, she followed the boy who skilfully avoided the guards. </p>
                        <p>He entered a two-storey building. </p>
                        <p>Robin used her magic to look through the walls. Inside, a bunch of young children were clinging onto the boy. He stole the bread for them. How noble.</p>
                        <p>He left in a hurry. Unfortunately for him, the guards seemed to know which path he would choose because they waited for him right there. </p>
                        <p>Before he was caught, he changed his route which bought him a bit of time. Left, right, left, right, right, another left… But how unlucky. </p>
                        <p><q>It's as if it's his first time in the town</q> Robin thought.</p>
                        <p>He ran right into a dead end. Now it is clear why it is called a 'dead' end. I wonder what the punishment for thievery in Cyan is.</p>
                        <p>Robin jumped on the flat roof of the house at the end of the dead end unnoticed. She held out her hand and spoke to the boy.</p>
                        <p><q>Need some help, Mr Thief?</q></p>
                        <p>He flinched as her voice took him by surprise. He finally saw her. Attempting to look composed, the thief spoke.</p>
                        <p><q>I don't need the help of a stranger.</q></p>
                        <p><q>Oh, so you'd rather wait for them to come?</q> said Robin pointing in the direction of the nearing guards.</p>
                        <p><q>…</q></p>
                        <p>The boy grabbed Robin's hand just before the guards made their last turn. Confused by their missing target, they headed back to search the streets once more.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Prince sighed.</p>
                        <p>The danger was over, but now he was sitting on a rooftop with a mysterious girl, who was certainly not from the town. He sensed a bit of danger as he couldn't see her face, because it was covered by a hood.</p>
                        <p>He decided to take the initiative.</p>
                        <p><q>Thank you for saving me. My name is Prince. You're not from Cyan, are you?</q></p>
                        <p>Something seemed to cross her mind for a second but then she answered rather cheerfully.</p>
                        <p><q>Between the two of us, you're the one who seems like an outsider. How could you run into *that* dead end? Even the children know the streets better than that.</q></p>
                        <p><q>So, you're from Cyan? How come it's the first time I've seen you?</q></p>
                        <p><q>Is it, really? Anyways, nice try to change the subject. For your interest, I am indeed from Cyan. Although I left a few years ago, I grew up here. The name's Robin. Nice to meet you</q> the girl said while removing her hood.</p>
                        <p>A sense of déjà vu crossed Prince's mind. </p>
                        <p><q>Nice to meet you, too.</q></p>
